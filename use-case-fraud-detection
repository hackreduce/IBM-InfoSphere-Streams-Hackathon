2. Real-time Analytics for Financial/Transactional Fraud Detection and Prevention 
Business Problem and Example Use Case

Financial institutions incur major losses due to fraudulent transactions.  Criminals blend fraudulent transactions with normal transactions, making it difficult to detect.  Real-time fraud detection requires consideration of a variety of factors.  This use case focuses on capturing and analyzing financial transaction data in real time to help identify fraud.  It uses advanced techniques such as machine learning, to flag fraudulent transactions from normal transactions.

Different modalities are used to flag transactions as regular/normal or fraudulent.  Also, user profile of card owners is used in conjunction with transaction behavior to determine abnormalities in transaction behavior.

Products Leveraged
The IBM products leveraged for this particular use case are:

InfoSphere Streams
SPSS Predictive Modeler
SPSS Solution Publisher
Assets Provided
Sample app, data set, etc.  (estimated under 100 MB)

SPSS based models and the analytic flows for learning anomaly detection and classification models automatically from data
Streams based applications for deploying those models for real-time detection / analysis
Dashboards developed using open-source charting tools (Java script, ...)
Synthetic data set
Suggested Hacks
The core idea behind the SPSS and Streams integration use-cases is the ability to learn advanced analytic models from historical data sets on storage (database, Netezza, filesystems), and apply those models in real-time on Streaming high-volume data. This is a widely applicable advanced analytics paradigm: can you think of new business domains where this concept can be applied and extended?  We point below to a variety of interesting business domains, data sources and data sets which you can download, experiment with and extend using the above mentioned Streams + SPSS integration capabilities (refer to the individual websites below for all the usage instructions, including the citation requirements).

0. Datasets and models created from SPSS for financial, predictive maintenance, and next best offer / web transaction domains is part of this attachment.

1. KDD Datasets: http://www.sigkdd.org/kddcup/index.php
    a) Click stream and purchase data from a real retailer
    b) Customer relationship prediction dataset
    c) Customer recommendations (the dataset linked in the above site focuses on movie rating behaviors); the idea would be to demonstrate next best actions / offers for the customer based on historical patterns
